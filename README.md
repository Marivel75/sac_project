## SAC website project

I am a member of a multisports and social british club in Paris suburb, The Standard Athletic Club.
The SAC would like to give a new look to its website, currently under Joomla.  This code is a project to redesign the website.

Language : PHP 7
Framework: Laravel
Template: FreeHTML5.co

## About Standard Athletic Club
The Standard Athletic Club is hidden in the forest of Meudon just minutes from the Etoile.
It is Paris's premier International English-speaking Sports and Social Club, the perfect place for all the family to play sports casually or competitively or just relax and enjoy the social life.
